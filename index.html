    <div><p style="text-align: center;">This website is meant to talk about your hobbies.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">&emsp;How you can develop new hobbies and how you can cope, when the ones you've had may affect your life
        whenever you can't practice them anymore or you don't want to do so.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="pic3.jpg" height="200" width="500" border="3spx"></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">We start with a small introduction...</p></div>
    
        <div class="center">
        <h2>..What are</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3 class=hh>hobbies?</h3></div>

    <div><p style="text-align: center;">If we would have to talk about hobbies, a hobby is an activity done for fun. <br>
        <b><u>Hobbies</u></b> are done during your time off, not professionally and typically done for no pay. <br>
        <b><u>Hobbies</u></b> include collecting things like stamps or Americana, engaging creative and artistic endeavors, playing sports, or exploring ideas and knowledge.</center>
        <img src="pic12.jpg" ALIGN="right" height="50" width="100">
        <img src="pic12.jpg" ALIGN="left" height="50" width="100">
        <p style="text-align:center;">Now let's corelate the hobbies with an other thing, like interesets.</p></div> 
    
        <div class="center">
        <h2>..What are</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>interesets?</h4></div>

    <p style="text-align: center";><b><u>Interests</u></b> are subjects that fascinate you and want to learn more about. <br>
        <b><u>Interests</u></b> are usually more about learning and discovering ideas, concepts, and knowledge like history, animal behavior, or even pop culture. <br>
        For example, if your interest is history, going to museums would be your hobby!!!</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Although they might resamble, they are different; <b><u>Hobbies</u></b> are activities that you engage in, while <b><u>Interests</u></b> are passive ideas or topics.</p>
</div>
        <p style="text-align: center">Most of the hobbies and interests you practice will say something about your identity, we will talk about that later on.</p>
    <div><p style="text-align: center">If you feel like you’re in a bit of a rut and you definitely don’t want to spend time watching yet another series, perhaps it’s time to find a new hobby?</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">People who are relaxed, with no stress, and they are apart of the quoutidian life, it is most likely they are the ones who have 
        hobbies, which improves their lives and their personality whilst doing them. <br>
        Things we are going to talk about on the next page; at the top of the page you see a button called "Different hobbies and the reasons to have one"
        all you have to do is to click it, I'll see you there!
